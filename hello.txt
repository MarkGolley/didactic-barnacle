Hey Liam, how's it going?

Wait... my name is not Liam?

Sorry about that Owen!

Have you got any word on Tharaka? It appears we are alone!

Tharaka, are you here?

Oh dear, I think he is lost. Maybe if we give him time, he will find his way back to here.

Ooops! I am here now!

Welcome!!

What took you so long?

sorry I was mesmerised by the lecture lol

It was breathtaking, you're right there!
